# Networking

## Assessment

* Is my network good enough for where I want to be in 5 years?
* What do I need to do to get it ready?
* Is it the right network?

## Mechanics

Show other person that you are happy to see her

* Keep positive things about person in mind

Show real interest in other person

* Listen
* Admire what they do!
* Ask for Advice

Invest time in doing other person a favour, the more you give on a consistent mode the more you get back

* congratulate to birthday
* make them a present (ideally sth. they mentioned)
* bring them an offering they can use (party, sport activity, business)
