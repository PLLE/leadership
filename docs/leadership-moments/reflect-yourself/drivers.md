## The Five Drivers by Taibi Kahler

Back in 1975 the American psychologist Taibi Kahler identified five common drivers that motivate us. These drivers are born in our unconsciousness and can lead to some very positive, as well as destructive behaviours. By identifying which drivers an individual displays most, it becomes possible to recognise and develop the potential of these positive behaviours. And to respond constructively to the negative. 

The 5 Drivers are:

* Please Others
* Be Strong
* Hurry Up
* Try Hard
* Be Perfect

In the end drivers are nothing bad, it just depends on the dose if they become threatening.

## Identify your drivers/ saboteurs and if there are effective or drive to much and by that are negative.

### Reflect on your drivers

* What surprised me? 
* Where was the driver active in the last couple of weeks? What triggers him?
* Which underlying belief is present? When I don't hurry up,...! When I don't do everything correct...!

## Advantages and Disadvantages of your drivers


## Question your drivers and give yourself permissions

* Please Others --> Please yourself!
* Be Strong --> Be open!
* Hurry Up --> Take your time!
* Try Hard --> Just do it!
* Be Perfect --> You are good enough!
