# Servant Leadership

The *Servant Leadership* style focuses on the leader's commitment to serving the needs of their team members. This leader prioritizes the well-being and development of the team, fostering a culture of collaboration and empowerment. While effective in building trust and employee satisfaction, the servant leadership style may face challenges if not balanced with clear direction and decision-making.
