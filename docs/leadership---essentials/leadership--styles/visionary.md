# Visionary Leadership

The *Visionary Leadership* style is marked by a leader who provides a clear vision for the future and rallies the team toward a common goal. This leader inspires confidence, fosters innovation, and encourages creative thinking. Unlike the commanding style, visionary leaders seek input from their team, fostering a collaborative and dynamic working environment.
