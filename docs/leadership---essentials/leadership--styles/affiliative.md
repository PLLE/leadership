# Affiliative Leadership

The *Affiliative Leadership* style focuses on building strong emotional bonds within the team. This leader values relationships, promotes a sense of belonging, and prioritizes open communication. While this style contributes to a positive work culture and employee satisfaction, it may be less effective in situations requiring tough decisions or immediate action.
