# Bureaucratic Leadership

The *Bureaucratic Leadership* style is characterized by a leader who follows established procedures and rules meticulously. This leader emphasizes precision, predictability, and efficiency. While effective in stable environments and industries that require strict compliance, an overreliance on bureaucratic leadership may stifle creativity and adaptability within the team.
