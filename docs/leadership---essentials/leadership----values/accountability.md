# Accountability

One of the values that many employees admire in a leader is accountability.
Accountability means taking responsibility for one’s duties and goals and, at times, owning responsibility for the shortcomings of one’s team.

However, strong leaders also need to be prepared to hold their employees accountable for the tasks they are responsible for, which helps to promote personal growth with your team.
They follow up on all outstanding issues, check in on employees, and monitor the effectiveness of company policies and procedures. When things are going well, they praise. When problems arise, they identify them quickly, seek solutions, and get things back on track.
