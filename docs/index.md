# Overview

## Vision

The vision behind this page is to build an "open-source" community for leadership!
The community consists of leadership enthusiasts which collaborately discuss and define modern leadership practices on this platform. <br>

Use this platform to reflect my leadership style and provide it as an example to the community.

## Structure

### Version 1

Leadership has many facettes, for the start we want to break it down into the following categories which will have many sub categories:

* Leading Self
* Leading Others
* Leading Organization
