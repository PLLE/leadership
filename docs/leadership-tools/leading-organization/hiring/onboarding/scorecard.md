# Onboarding Milestones aka The Ninety-Day Scorecard

As discussed in the hiring challenge, hiring is very hard. Even the most thoughtful hiring processes will not achieve a 100 percent success rate. Said another way, mis-hires are inevitable.

The best way to handle the potential for unsuccessful hires is first to have the humility to acknowledge that your hiring process isn't perfect, and then to be thoughtful about how to measure the success of the new employees and take swift action to correct any mistakes. The process should be transparent upfront to new employees, clearly explaining expectations. Managers should work with new employees to make sure their role is a mutual fit, that the new employee is starting to feel at home in the role, and that they are delivering at a level commensurate with what they were hired for. At sixty or ninety days, it should be clear to both the new employee and the manager whether those expectations are being met.

If there is disagreement on whether the employee is being successful, that's a good sign that it's not working out, and you should consider relatively quickly whether there is another spot on the team where the new employee might be a better fit, or if both sides might be better off parting ways.

## The Scorecard

It is the responsibility of the manager of the new employee to identify and document measurable milestones for any new role before the new employee starts. On Day 1 the manager should walk through the milestones with the new employee, collect feedback, and collaborate on those milestones to ensure they are fair and clearly measurable. For some roles, these milestones may be easy and clear, such as in a support role measuring escalation tickets with ticket throughput. For other roles you may need to get more creative, for example, features delivered or story points closed. Regardless of the milestones you choose, the scorecard should do the following:

Establish clear and transparent expectations between the manager and the new employee.
Provide guidance for the new employee on what they will do and how they'll be measured in their first ninety days.
Provide obvious criteria for meeting or not meeting the expectations of their role.
The scorecard doesn't have to be lengthy or highly nuanced. The key thing is that, whatever form it takes, after ninety days the employee and manager can look at the scorecard and agree on how the employee has performed and have a shared feeling of confidence on whether this is going to be a good long-term fit.

A quick word on the ninety-day length: ninety days is a commonly used timeframe for onboarding new employees, but it is not a hard rule. A thirty-day interval is generally too short in engineering, where there is a significant learning curve to mastering your technology, tools, and product. On the contrary, waiting a full performance cycle e.g., six or twelve months leaves a potentially poor fit in the role for too long, preventing them from getting the remediation they need to achieve productivity, and costing the company lost time and productivity. The right answer is likely in between, and the exact amount of time is up to you and your managers.

## Handling a scorecard failure

If, after ninety days, the manager and the employee agree things are not meeting expectations, or there isn't agreement on whether expectations are being met, something has to change. This doesn't mean you have to fire the new employee, but it does mean you have to do something. Consider the following options in this scenario:

Is the problem the manager? Would this person be more successful on another team or with a different manager?

If you suspect this is the case, consider a lateral move before moving to termination.
Is there a cultural misalignment?

Realigning an employee to your culture after a misalignment is identified is challenging and rarely successful. If you're concerned you may be in this scenario at ninety days, almost certainly the right option is to part ways, and more likely than not the candidate will be just as relieved as the manager.
Is it a lack of experience or skill?

If you hired someone at a senior level but they're performing at mid-level, you have the option of attempting to down-level them. After all, it's unfair to other employees to keep this person on and pay them as a senior-level performer if they're not delivering at that level. Be warned, however, that down-leveling is very challenging. Unless expectations are very carefully managed, down-leveling will often result in bruised ego and ultimately prove unproductive or even toxic to your team.
LETTING A NEW EMPLOYEE GO

In general, if it's not clear after ninety days that a hire is going to work out, it likely won't magically become better after 120 or 150 days, and it's best to let them go. You should terminate this employee the same as any other, with a full severance package and as much kindness as possible.

I encourage you to take full ownership of the mis-hire. If you hired them, take responsibility; it means your hiring process isn't perfect. Don't penalize the employee for it. An industry-standard severance package at a startup is four weeks salary, benefits if you can extend them, and assistance finding another job in any way you're comfortable offering.
