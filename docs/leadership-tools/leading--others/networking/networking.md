# Networking

## Assessment

* Is my network good enough for where I want to be in 5 years?
* What do I need to do to get it ready?
* Is it the right network?

## Why Networking?

People who have strong and diverse networks, live longer, are stronger mentally and physically, earn more money and are happier.

## Network Diversity

## Key Skills for networking

* Curiosity/ Asking
And great networkers understand the power of asking, not just for business, but for advice and suggestions and opinions, ideas, referrals, introductions. They see asking as their most powerful marketing tool and they're curious and they ask great questions. Every successful person is a curious person. It's a way to build a reservoir of ideas and opinions. Good networkers are good connectors and good connectors are curious people.

* Listening

## Characteristics of good networkers

* Great networkers work hard at networking all the time. 
* They know that networks don't just happen, you have to work at them. 
* They're humble. 
* They don't brag about their networking and they don't keep score. 
* They don't say, "Hey, I did you a favor some time ago so you owe me one, pal." 
* They are quietly confident that connecting people will result in something great even if it's unclear what that is. They know that their relationships are living, breathing things and if they're not looked after, they'll wither and die. 
* They understand they can't know everything, no matter how good they are. And the way to information and people they don't know is through people they do know. 
* They think like farmers who plant a seed in the spring and are confident that there'll be a harvest in the autumn. They know they can't plant a seed today and harvest tomorrow. And they know there's a difference between formal information and informal information.

Great networkers are great salespeople because they create a vast and spreading sphere of goodwill. They enrich, enhance, and add value to people's lives. They network with the three Es: energy, enthusiasm, and empathy. And you know what? They make people happier.

## How to extend your network
And they realize they need to have a wide array of weak connections that would bridge them into different networks, give them access to diverse views, so they spend time hanging out on the edge of their network, knowing that this would give them a wide range of connections and opinions.
