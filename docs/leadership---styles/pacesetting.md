# Pacesetting Leadership

The *Pacesetting Leadership* style involves a leader who sets high performance standards for themselves and expects the same from their team. This leader leads by example and values excellence. While effective in maintaining high standards and promoting a results-driven culture, the pacesetting style may lead to burnout and decreased morale if not balanced with support and encouragement.
