# Democratic Leadership

The *Democratic Leadership* style emphasizes collaboration and decision-making through group consensus. Leaders using this style value input from team members, fostering a sense of inclusivity and shared responsibility. While democratic leadership can enhance creativity and engagement, it may be time-consuming and less effective in situations requiring quick and decisive action.
