# Commanding Leader

The commanding leader is someone who demands immediate compliance and focuses on achieving results. This style can be effective in situations where urgent action is needed, such as during a crisis. The commanding leader is decisive, takes charge, and expects subordinates to follow instructions without much room for discussion.

While the commanding style can be useful in certain circumstances, Goleman also emphasizes the importance of using a range of leadership styles depending on the situation. Overreliance on the commanding style may lead to negative consequences, such as resentment or a lack of creativity among team members.
