# Charismatic Leadership

The *Charismatic Leadership* style involves a leader who inspires and motivates through their personal charisma. This leader is often dynamic, persuasive, and able to articulate a compelling vision. While charismatic leaders can foster enthusiasm and commitment, the success of the team may become overly dependent on the leader's personality, potentially causing challenges during their absence.
