# Transactional Leadership

The *Transactional Leadership* style involves a leader who uses a structured approach to motivate and manage their team. This leader establishes clear expectations, rewards compliance, and addresses deviations from established norms. While effective in maintaining order and achieving short-term goals, transactional leadership may lack the flexibility needed for innovation and long-term growth.
