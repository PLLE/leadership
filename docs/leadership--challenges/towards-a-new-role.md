# Journey towards a new career step

## Why you as a leader need to support it

The lack of career development is the top reason for people to quit their job. (McKinsey)

--> Thatâ€™s why it is so important for you to support your team members in taking the next career step, ideally even outside of your own team.

People who unsuccessfully apply for jobs internally are 150% more likely to leave the company in the following 6 months.

--> This calls for you as a leader to support your team members when they want to take the next step on their internal growth journey.

## In the process

* Be a people developer
* Be supportive
* Think of entire company and not only your department
* share success stories

## When leaving

* Ensure aligned communication and a well ordered hand over
* have a personal farewell and acknowledge achievements
* Stay in contact when members leave the team

## Reflection

Think of a situation when you changed your job within a company.
What did your leader do to make you feel supported in this development step?
What would you have wished for from your leader?
What were your concerns and needs?
What did you learn from this experience that you intend to apply when one of your own team members is changing jobs within Siemens?
