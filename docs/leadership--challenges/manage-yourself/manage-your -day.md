# Manage your day

This chapter is mainly inspired by the book "How to have a good day" of Caroline Webb.

## Priorities

Our focus/ goals/ mood determines what our "fast" brain filters and draws our focus on.

### Setting great goals

Take a moment now to think about your priorities for today.

* Set some behavioral goals. Personally, what behavior of yours will support your intentions for the day? Specifically, what tangible actions can you plan to take? Put these on your to-do list along with your regular tasks.
* Articulate your goals for the win. Phrase them so that they're positive, meaningful, feasible, and situation-specific.
* Create "approach" goals. Make sure your goals are about doing desirable things, or doing more of them, rather than avoiding bad things happening. If they're negative in tone, turn them around.
* Find a personal why. Can you articulate why the goal matters to you or how it will benefit something you care about?
* Break off bite-sized chunks. If the actions to take are unclear, break your goal down into smaller, bite-sized chunks. Get especially clear on the very first step to take to make progress.
* Make a "when-then" plan. Define clear situational prompts ("when X happens, then I will do Y") to increase the chances that you'll get your most important goals met today.

Create a brain-friendly to-do list. Whichever approach you take to task management, make sure you don't overload your brain's working memory and that you feed your reward system.

### Set your intentions & set your filters

Take a moment to think about the day ahead, or an important conversation you have coming up. Ask yourself these intention-setting questions:

* Aim: What matters most in making this a success, and what does that mean your real priority should be?
* Attitude: What concerns are dominating your thoughts or your mood? Do they help you with your prioritiesâ€” and if not, can you chose to set them aside for now?
* Assumptions: What negative expectations do you have going into this? How might you challenge those expectations? What counterevidence might you seek out?
* Attention: Given your real aim and your assumptions, where do you most want to direct your attention? What do you want to make particularly sure you notice?

### Reinforcing your intentions

Consider taking a moment now to revisit your intentions and goals for the day ahead. For the most important of them:

* Mental contrasting. What's most likely to get in the way of you achieving what you hope to do? What can you do to reduce the chance that this obstacle derails you ideally by making a specific "when-then" plan?
* Priming. What cues can you use to remind yourself to stay on track today? Are there words or phrases that will help remind you of your intentions? How can you make your surroundings a good metaphor for your intentions?
* Mind's-eye rehearsal. Take a moment to visualize the most important part of your day going exactly as you hope. What will you be doing to overcome the challenges in your path? How will that look and feel? Can you recall a time in the past where you behaved just as you want to behave today, and bring that vividly to mind?

### Tool daily reflections

* Direct your attention to what matters most!

Goal Refinement

* Set goals! Find personal why!
* Break down goals into To Do's
* Set a goal how you want to behave and add to To-Do's. (e.g. listen, appreciate,...)
