# Onboarding

## Goals

* Appreciation fpr new hire: A good onboarding experience helps a new hire to feel integrated into your company and culture and become productive as quickly as possible.
* Build Culture: Good onboarding emphasizes a culture of continuous improvement, helping to streamline the process for future hires and enhance the scalability of your overall processes.
* Evaluate the quality of the hire: Good onboarding provides structure for both the new employee and their manager, including clear goals that, when achieved, demonstrate that you've hired well for the role.

Ground rules:
* Onboarding process should be consistent across teams


## Timeline

Onboarding begins the second somebody agrees to work at your company and signs their offer letter. You should be thinking about how to make your new employee successful even before their first day. Not every new employee will be eager to spend their own time learning about the company or their role in advance of their start date, but depending on the task or what's offered, many will volunteer to do so.

I encourage you to send candidates your Day 1 Guide as well as your guidebook the day they sign their offer letter. If you have a company reading list, now is a good time to order those books and have them either shipped to the candidate or offer them in eBook/audiobook format. Most candidates are not at all interested in reading/writing code before Day 1, but learning about your culture or reading high-caliber books on business/culture/ engineering is rarely perceived as a burden. You shouldn't require this activity, but by making it available you'll likely get fairly healthy volunteer participation.

On their actual start date, the candidate should meet with their new manager first thing in the morning and check in. If they haven't read through the materials you sent them in advance of their arrival, set the expectation that they are to do so on Day 1. They should schedule follow-up time to review the ninety-day scorecard after the candidate has had a chance to review the introductory materials and set up their environment/logins. This is also a good time to reinforce the idea of continuous improvement and encourage the candidate to take ownership of any hiccups in their onboarding and contribute to improving the documentation and process for whoever follows them next onto the team.
