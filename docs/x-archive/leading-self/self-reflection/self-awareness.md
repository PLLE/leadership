How to avoid problem focused thinking?

# 1 Self-knowledge

In order to avoid problem focused thinking and to replace it with solution-oriented thinking we firstly need to discover that we approach different tasks, problems, challenges, etc. in a problem-oriented way. This is the utmost important step to do. You can identify whether you approach tasks problem-oriented by paying attention towards the questions that arise when you have to face a task that you do not like, which might be indicators for problem focused thinking:
Why do I have to perform this task?
What is the reason that I have to study this subject?
Why do I even spend time with this?

# 2 Fight problem-oriented questions

The very first step to approach problems with solution focused thinking is to avoid questions that mainly focus on the reason or the problem in general. You need to clarify yourself that the question for the “WHY” will only waste important time that you could have invested to solve a given problem.

# 3 Clarity

When you come to the conclusion that a task needs to be done you will see the pointlessness of further evaluating the usefulness or non-usefulness of a task. So when you have to face a task that you dislike you could ask yourself the question, “Has this task to be fulfilled?” and when you conclude that the answer is “Yes”, then you know that every further attempt to evaluate the reasons and the “Why’s” is a waste of time.

# 4 Why is it important to solve this task?

Questioning and clarifying the importance of a task will finally erase the root cause of every problem-oriented question. By clarifying the reasons why a task needs to be performed we can effectively change our focus from the problem to possible solutions.

# 5 Think about the solution

The final step to profit from solution focused thinking the most is to ask yourself different questions on how you can solve a given task or problem:
How can I solve this task?
How can I address this problem?
What would be the first step to solving this problem?
What kind of preparations will be necessary for this task?
