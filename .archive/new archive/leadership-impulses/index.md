# üõ†Ô∏è Leadership tools

## Goal

My goal with the description of the tools is not to provide an exhaustive discussion or review on the topic. Instead, the goal is to introduce the topic, provide an overview or a structure for thinking about it, offer some best practices, and suggest reference material to explore the subject more deeply. Think of this collection as a breadth-first collection of topics related to technical leadership. It's up to the reader to determine which topics are most interesting to them, and, equipped with some context and perspective, do a deep dive on what's most relevant and put the knowledge into practice.
If there are things in this collection you disagree with or believe are incorrect please open an issue or comment. Thank you very much for your help!

## Structure

For easier navigation I structered the tools in the following sections:

1. **Leading Self** - How do I lead myself and maintain my inner stability under stress and pressure?
2. **Leading Relations** -How do I lead and inspire others, engage them, provide direction, and develop their performance?
3. **Leading Teams and Organizations** - How do I achieve outstanding team performance, create effective processes and enable cooperation and creativity?
