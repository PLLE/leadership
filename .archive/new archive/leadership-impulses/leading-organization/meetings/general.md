Set up clear agenda
Invite only needed people

Share a good deal of information upfront
Provide written information about meeting content. Make sure it’s informative for persons who did not attend the meeting.
Deliver it timely. Like, right after the meeting. The easiest way to achieve that is to write a live protocol. You can do that collaboratively.
Do not make decisions in a meeting without sharing information upfront. Even worse: without telling on the agenda that you will ask for a decision.

INSTEAD OF MEETINGS use asynchronous communication:
 But they also use tickets in Jira, comments on Confluence pages, and announce important changes in Teams or Slack channels. They create Merge Requests for code changes and discuss right next to the code.

## Ask for value of meeting in the end

## Icebreakers

## Small talk

Five alternatives to ‘What do you do?’
1. What are you passionate about?
2. What do you do for fun?
3. What problem do you wish you could solve?
4. What’s the most interesting thing you’ve learned recently?
5. What are you looking forward to at the moment?
