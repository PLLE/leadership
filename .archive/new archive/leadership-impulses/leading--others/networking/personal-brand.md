# Personal Brand

So create content that consistently emphasizes your personal brand. You are the brand, so make sure that everything you do reinforces that, and that there's congruence between your online persona and your real life persona. Creating your personal brand style matters and helps you stand out. Everything from clothing, letterheads, hairstyles, zoom background, conversation style, all get you noticed. Little choices can have big impacts and make memorable impressions. You see, it's a tough, competitive world out there. So you need to proactively take control of your personal brand and see it as a defensive tool against being overlooked and an offensive tool for getting noticed. One of the things that you need to be able to show proof that reinforces your personal brand. That's all about your credentials and qualifications, any publications you have, the articles you've written, the awards and recognition you may have got, great client testimonials, your ability to speak publicly. Build an online identity that attracts a tribe of people.
