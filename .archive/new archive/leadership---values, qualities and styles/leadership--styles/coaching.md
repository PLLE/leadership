# Coaching Leadership

The *Coaching Leadership* style focuses on the personal and professional development of team members. This leader provides guidance, feedback, and opportunities for skill-building. While effective in promoting long-term growth and loyalty within the team, the coaching style may require significant time and effort, making it less suitable for quick decision-making scenarios.
