# Honesty and transparency

Employees want a coach and leader who is honest and transparent about their performance, business objectives and directives, and internal company politics.
Nobody likes to feel like they are being lied to or deceived. A little leadership authenticity goes a long way.

Transparency does not mean telling everyone everything as soon as you hear it — there is a time and a manner in which to convey information.
You want to be aware of how new information impacts people and impart it with care, utilizing values we’ve discussed like empathy, communication, and respect.

Take a company reorganization, for example. You don’t want to sound the alarm that change is coming before you’ve worked out the details. Nor do you want to spring the news on people the day before everything shifts.

Valuing transparency, in this case, would mean communicating why there is a reorganization and getting other company leaders on board with how it affects them and their teams. It could also include hosting a Q&A for everyone who will be affected and setting clear expectations for how and when changes will occur. Share information openly, and avoid spin control.

“Being transparent about our plans enables us to get better feedback.”(Shantanu Narayen, chairman, president, and CEO of Adobe Inc)
