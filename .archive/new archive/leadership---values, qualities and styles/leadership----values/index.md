# ❤️ Leadership Values

## What are leadership values?

Values are the underlying beliefs that guide our decisions and actions and ultimately shape our days and careers.
Leadership values are a subset of those values that positively influence one’s ability to lead effectively and be a ‘good leader.’

You can foster and develop leadership values with time. However, as with many character traits, you will probably have a tendency toward one specific leadership skill or another.

## The importance of a leader with values

Everyone has values, but not everyone exhibits good leadership values.
Anyone in a leadership role should be aware of the values they hold, their strengths, and the areas they can improve on as they grow as a leader.
Values are more intrinsic and reflect the leader's character. They influence how a leader prioritizes goals, treats others, and makes ethical decisions.

**Why?**

Because your values determine how you execute leadership, the team environment you create, and the success of your company. The values you display as a leader will permeate your entire organization and affect its performance.

Leaders who adhere to their values earn respect and commitment from their teams. Value-driven leadership can inspire others not just to follow them but to adopt those values as their own.  

By embracing the notion that you can develop leadership qualities, you can also choose leadership values to develop. This is possible both through leadership training and mindful attention and practice.

## Important leaderhip values

* Accountability - ownership
* Psychological Safety - room for error
* Openness and Collaboration - breaking down silos

* Integrity
* Honesty and transparency
* Respect

## How to identify your leadership values

Becoming a great leader is a journey that will last your entire career.
Of course, the sooner you start focusing on these leadership values, the faster you’ll become the leader you want to be:

You can uncover these natural leadership values by asking yourself questions such as:

* What values guide my personal life?
* How do I react in common situations (such as when confronted with change)?
* What kind of leaders do I gravitate to (such as a passionate leader or a more strategic leader)? Do you gravitate toward leaders who lead with a strategic foresight?
* What are the goals, mission, and culture of my company?

The leadership values related to effective leadership at your company will lie at the intersection of your personal values and your company’s values.
