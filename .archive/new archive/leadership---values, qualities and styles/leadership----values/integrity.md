# Integrity

Integrity is a character trait that gains respect and trust.
As a leader, integrity means approaching all of your work with consistency and coherency: the way you communicate with others, carry out your organization’s mission, and approach new situations.
Integrity means honoring commitments (including to yourself) and doing what you say you will do, as well as approaching challenges in ways that are coherent with other values and beliefs.

Leading with integrity can sound abstract because it encapsulates so much, but you can think of it as integrating all of your core leadership values — the end doesn’t justify the means if the means violate our core values.

The people who work for us notice if we only exhibit our values when times are good. By knowing your leadership values, reviewing them, and having them guide your actions, you will be leading with integrity no matter what your company faces.
