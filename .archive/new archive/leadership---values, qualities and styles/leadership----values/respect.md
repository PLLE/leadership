# Respect

As a leader, you can demonstrate respect through many of the behaviors already listed here:

* Empowering others
* Strong communication skills
* Recognition of employee abilities
* Empathizing with the situations of others

Respect should also move in all directions. Treat upper management, your board, employees, and customers with the respect they deserve to gain respect in return.

Itâ€™s also important to build a culture where differences are respected and appreciated. Having diverse viewpoints within the organization is a strength, and those who differ from you in opinion should feel as valued as those aligned with you.
