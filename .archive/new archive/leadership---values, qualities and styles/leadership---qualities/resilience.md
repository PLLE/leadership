# Resilience

A key nature of business is change, and as a leader, you often take the brunt of big changes — or even initiate them.
You must be able to weather these times, not only for yourself but for your team.
This is not to say you can’t have human reactions to challenges, but ultimately your team will respond to how you handle hardship and communicate the outcomes.
Employees look to their leaders for cues during unpredictable phases, and a show of resilience at the top will bolster the entire organization.

Resilience has tangible positive outcomes as well. As BetterUp’s study on resilience shows, it increases revenue, encourages innovation, and retains employees.
