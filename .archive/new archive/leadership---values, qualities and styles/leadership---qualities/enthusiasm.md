# Passion, enthusiasm and commitment

An extraordinary leader is not only capable of commanding influence or communicating successfully.

They are also:

* committed to meeting organizational goals 
* passionate about the company and their leadership role within it
* and demonstrate ferocious resolve when faced with adversity

A leader with this kind of mindset can motivate everyone around them. Their passion and energy are so infectious that it drives and uplifts the entire team. True passion and enthusiasm for a business, its products, and its mission cannot be faked. Employees can recognize insincere cheerleading from a mile away. However, when leaders are sincerely enthusiastic and passionate, thatâ€™s contagious.
