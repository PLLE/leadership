# ðŸ¦„ Leadership Qualities

## What are leadership qualities?

Leadership qualities are the traits, characteristics, and skills that contribute to a person's ability to lead effectively. These are often observable and can be developed or enhanced over time.
Nature: Qualities are more outwardly focused and represent the leader's capabilities and behaviors. They influence how a leader interacts with others, makes decisions, and addresses challenges.

Examples: Communication skills, emotional intelligence, adaptability, decisiveness, and the ability to inspire and motivate others are examples of leadership qualities.

## Important leadership qualities

Self
* Growth minded (humility)

Others
* Coaching (asking the right questions)
* Empowerment and development

Organization
* Vision
* Passion, enthusiasm and commitment

* Empathy
* Communication
* Reinforcement and influence
* Nurtures growth
* Fosters a sense of connection and belonging
* Focus
* Confidence
* Optimism
* Patience
* Resilience
* Provides direction

Put it all together, and what emerges is a picture of the truly inspiring leader: someone who communicates clearly, concisely, and often, and by doing so motivates everyone to give his or her best all the time. They challenge their people by setting high but attainable standards and expectations, and then giving them the support, tools, training, and latitude to pursue those goals and become the best employees they can possibly be.

## Succesful leadership quality patterns

### Cheetahs --> 100% successful

* **Agility and Speed:** Cheetahs are known for their speed and agility. In a leadership context, "cheetahs" may represent leaders who are quick to adapt to changes, make decisions swiftly, and navigate challenges with agility.

* **Assertiveness:** Cheetahs are assertive predators. In leadership, this could translate to leaders who are decisive, assert their authority when needed, and are proactive in achieving goals.

* **Competitiveness:** Cheetahs are highly competitive in the animal kingdom. In leadership, this trait might be associated with leaders who thrive in competitive environments, set ambitious goals, and drive their teams to excel.

### Lambs  --> 57% successful

* **Empathy and Compassion:** Lambs are often associated with gentleness and innocence. In a leadership context, "lambs" may represent leaders who prioritize empathy, compassion, and a nurturing approach to team members.

* **Collaboration:** Lambs are social animals that often move in flocks. Leaders adopting a "lamb" approach may emphasize collaboration, teamwork, and building strong relationships within the team.

* **Servant Leadership:** The lamb metaphor could align with the concept of servant leadership, where leaders prioritize the well-being and development of their team, fostering a supportive and inclusive work environment.

It's crucial to recognize that these metaphors are simplifications, and effective leadership often requires a combination of traits. Additionally, the interpretation of these metaphors may vary, and different authors or leadership experts might use these terms in distinct ways. Always consider the specific context in which these metaphors are employed in any given leadership literature.
